# Title

Very WIP project for a Sekiro character in Your Only Move Is HUSTLE.

General file layout is as follows:

- "Sounds" folder contains the character's sounds. Its "src" folder contains JSON files to be used with [JFXR](https://jfxr.frozenfractal.com/).
- "Sprites" folder contains the character's sprites. These are Aseprite files that get exported to the character's assets.
- "characters" folder is the character's assets, for use with the [Character Loader](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2931479403) mod.

Credits go to FrozenFractal (@ttkencate) for creating an awesome synthesizer tool to make sounds.
